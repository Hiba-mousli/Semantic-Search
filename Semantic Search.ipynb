    "[Hugging face](https://huggingface.co/) is an NLP-focused startup with a large open-source community, in particular around the Transformers library. 🤗 Transformers is a python-based library that exposes an API to use many well-known transformer architectures, such as BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2 or DistilBERT, that obtain state-of-the-art results on a variety of NLP tasks like text classification, information extraction, question answering, and text generation. Those architectures come pre-trained with several sets of weights. Getting started with Transformers only requires to install the pip package:"
